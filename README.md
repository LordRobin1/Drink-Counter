# Drink Counter

Simple App to track your drinks :)  

## Build

- Clone the repository
- First do `npm i` and then complete step 1 + 2 [here](https://docs.expo.dev/build/setup/) (you'll need an [expo](https://expo.dev) account).  
- Now you should be able to build the `apk` via `eas build -p android --profile preview`.
- Download the `.apk` and somehow transfer it to your phone (Google Drive maybe?)
- Trust the developer and install
